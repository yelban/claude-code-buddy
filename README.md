> **Make Claude Code remember your project, learn from your feedback, and give you expert-level responses without expert-level prompts.**

Claude Code Buddy is a Claude Code Plugin that adds intelligence, memory, and task routing to Claude Code - turning it from a powerful assistant into a project-aware AI teammate.

---

## The Problem

You're using Claude Code to build your project, but you keep hitting the same frustrations:

- **"Didn't we already discuss this?"** - Claude forgets context between sessions
- **"Why am I explaining this again?"** - Every conversation starts from zero
- **"This answer is too generic"** - Same response whether you're debugging, reviewing code, or designing UI
- **"Let me write this 50-line prompt... again"** - Repetitive instructions for common tasks

**You end up being Claude's memory and project manager instead of focusing on building.**

---

## The Solution

Claude Code Buddy sits between you and Claude Code, adding three superpowers:

### 1. 🧠 **Project Memory**

CCB remembers your architecture decisions, coding patterns, and past solutions. Ask "Why did we choose PostgreSQL?" and get the actual decision rationale - not a generic comparison.

### 2. 🎯 **Smart Task Routing**

Your request gets analyzed and routed to the right "expert mode" - code review tasks get code review expertise, debugging gets systematic debugging methodology, frontend gets UI/UX best practices.

### 3. 💰 **Smart Model Selection**

Routes tasks to the right Claude model based on complexity:

- **Haiku** (simple tasks) - Fast & cheap
- **Sonnet** (medium tasks) - Balanced performance
- **Opus** (complex tasks) - Maximum capability

Saves ~40% on token costs by using smaller models for simpler tasks.

**Result:** Expert responses without expert prompts. Context that persists. Cost-effective intelligence that never forgets.

### What does "evolves with your project" actually mean?

CCB does not retrain models or modify Claude itself.

Instead, evolution comes from a **persistent system layer** inside the Claude Code plugin:

• **Project memory accumulation**
Architectural decisions, conventions, and resolved discussions are stored as structured context.

• **Pattern reinforcement**
Repeated approvals, refactors, and preferred solutions gradually shape how future prompts are constructed.

• **Task-type differentiation**
Review, debugging, refactoring, and design tasks are handled with different internal prompting strategies.

• **Context reuse, not repetition**
Relevant memory is selectively injected, avoiding prompt bloat while preserving continuity.

Over time, Claude Code responses become:
• more aligned with your conventions
• more consistent across sessions
• less dependent on verbose prompts

This is *behavioral evolution through system memory and routing*, not model fine-tuning.

## See It In Action

**Without CCB:**

```
You: "Optimize this database query"
Claude: [Generic advice about indexes and query structure]
```

**With CCB:**

```
You: "Optimize this database query"

CCB analyzes: Database optimization task
CCB routes to: database optimization capability
CCB enhances prompt with: DB best practices, indexing strategies, profiling techniques

Claude: [Specific optimization for YOUR database setup, with actual query examples
         and performance benchmarks based on your schema]
```

**The difference:** CCB knows your stack, remembers your schema, and delivers targeted expertise.

## How to Use CCB

After installation, CCB works **two ways**:

### 🔄 Automatic Mode (Just Talk Normally)

CCB enhances your requests automatically in the background. No special commands needed:

```
You: "Review this code for security issues"
     ↓
CCB automatically:
  • Detects task type → code review
  • Routes to → security review capability
  • Enhances prompt with → security checklist, best practices
     ↓
Claude responds with specialized security expertise
```

**Just use Claude Code as usual** - CCB works invisibly to improve responses.

### 🎮 Buddy Commands (Explicit Control)

Use these commands when you want specific CCB features:

| Command | What It Does | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| `buddy-do` | Execute task with smart routing | `buddy-do "setup user authentication"` |
| `buddy-remember` | Search project memory | `buddy-remember "why did we choose PostgreSQL"` |
| `buddy-help` | Get help on any command | `buddy-help remember` |

### 💾 Project Memory

Project memory is captured automatically as you work. Use `buddy-remember` to recall key decisions and recent progress.

Project memory is automatic. Use `buddy-remember` to recall decisions, patterns, and recent work.

## Key Features

### ✨ Automatic Expertise Routing

CCB routes requests to internal specialists based on capability signals. You describe intent, CCB handles routing.

**Capabilities include:**
- Code review, security audits, and best-practice validation
- Debugging and root-cause analysis
- Refactoring and technical debt reduction
- API design, backend architecture, and database optimization
- Testing strategy and generation
- Performance profiling and optimization
- UI/UX design and technical writing
- Research, product, and planning support

### 💾 Memory Systems

**Knowledge Graph**

```
You: "Why did we choose this architecture?"
CCB: [Recalls the decision, the alternatives considered, and the tradeoffs]
```

**Project Context**

```
CCB remembers:
- Your coding standards
- Naming conventions
- Project-specific patterns
- What you've already built
```

### 💰 Smart Model Selection & Cost Savings

CCB analyzes task complexity and routes to the optimal Claude model, saving ~40% on token costs:

- **Haiku** (simple/cheap) - Quick tasks like code formatting, simple bug fixes
- **Sonnet** (balanced) - Standard development work, code reviews
- **Opus** (complex/quality) - Architecture design, complex debugging

**How it works**: TaskAnalyzer examines your request → Estimates complexity (1-10) → Routes to the most cost-effective Claude model → You get quality results without overpaying for simple tasks.

**Real example**: "Fix this typo" uses Haiku (fast & cheap), "Design authentication system" uses Opus (maximum capability), "Review this PR" uses Sonnet (balanced).

### 🤝 User-Friendly Commands

```bash
# Simple commands that just work
buddy-do "setup authentication"
buddy-do "optimize this database query"
buddy-remember "how we implemented login"
buddy-help
```

### 🔄 Intelligent Workflow Guidance

**CCB knows what's next.** After you write code, it suggests running tests. After tests pass, it suggests code review. No manual thinking required.

```
You write code → CCB: "Code looks good! Run tests next?"
Tests pass → CCB: "Tests green! Ready for code review?"
Review done → CCB: "Review complete! Commit and push?"
```

**Workflow tools:**

- `get-workflow-guidance` - Get next-step recommendations
- `get-session-health` - Check session health status

**Benefits:** Never wonder "what should I do next?" - CCB guides you through the complete development flow.

### 📋 Smart Implementation Planning

**Break down complex features into bite-sized tasks.** CCB generates TDD-structured plans with capability-aware task breakdown.

```
You: "Plan implementation for user authentication"
CCB: [Generates step-by-step plan with:
  - Test-first approach
  - 2-5 minute tasks
  - Right capability for each task
  - Clear success criteria]
```

**Planning tool:**

- `generate-smart-plan` - Create intelligent implementation plans

## What CCB Does Well ✅

- **Makes Claude Code context-aware** for your specific project
- **Reduces repetitive prompting** through intelligent task routing
- **Remembers between sessions** with persistent memory systems (Knowledge Graph + Project Context)
- **Provides specialized expertise** without you writing expert prompts
- **Saves token costs** by routing to optimal Claude models (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)
- **Learns from your choices** when you override recommendations
- **Guides your workflow** with intelligent next-step recommendations
- **Coordinates complex workflows** across multiple steps
- **Cross-platform support** works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Production-ready** with comprehensive testing, security hardening, and resource protection

## Honest Limitations ⚠️

- **Not magic** - Still needs clear requirements from you
- **Not a replacement for learning** - You should understand what you're building
- **Enhances Claude Code, doesn't replace it** - Works alongside your existing setup
- **Requires setup** - 2-minute install, not one-click (yet)
- **Early stage (v2.0)** - Expect rough edges, but actively improving
- **Limited by Claude's capabilities** - Can't make Claude do impossible things

**Philosophy:** We're honest about what works and what doesn't. If something doesn't work for you, let us know - that feedback makes it better for everyone.
