Claude Code Buddy is an MCP server that adds intelligence, memory, and task routing to Claude Code - turning it from a powerful assistant into a project-aware AI teammate.

---

## The Problem

You're using Claude Code to build your project, but you keep hitting the same frustrations:

- **"Didn't we already discuss this?"** - Claude forgets context between sessions
- **"Why am I explaining this again?"** - Every conversation starts from zero
- **"This answer is too generic"** - Same response whether you're debugging, reviewing code, or designing UI
- **"Let me write this 50-line prompt... again"** - Repetitive instructions for common tasks

**You end up being Claude's memory and project manager instead of focusing on building.**

---

## The Solution

Claude Code Buddy sits between you and Claude Code, adding three superpowers:

### 1. 🧠 **Project Memory**
CCB remembers your architecture decisions, coding patterns, and past solutions. Ask "Why did we choose PostgreSQL?" and get the actual decision rationale - not a generic comparison.

### 2. 🎯 **Smart Task Routing**
Your request gets analyzed and routed to the right "expert mode" - code review tasks get code review expertise, debugging gets systematic debugging methodology, frontend gets UI/UX best practices.

### 3. 💰 **Smart Model Selection**
Routes tasks to the right Claude model (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus) based on complexity, saving ~40% on token costs without sacrificing quality.

**Result:** Expert responses without expert prompts. Context that persists. Cost-effective intelligence that never forgets.

---

## See It In Action

**Without CCB:**
```
You: "Optimize this database query"
Claude: [Generic advice about indexes and query structure]
```

**With CCB:**
```
You: "Optimize this database query"

CCB analyzes: Database optimization task
CCB routes to: db-optimizer agent type
CCB enhances prompt with: DB best practices, indexing strategies, profiling techniques

Claude: [Specific optimization for YOUR database setup, with actual query examples
         and performance benchmarks based on your schema]
```

**The difference:** CCB knows your stack, remembers your schema, and delivers targeted expertise.

</details>

### 💾 Three Types of Memory

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with Drop Inbox**
```
You: "Show me how authentication works in this project"
CCB: [Searches your codebase, finds actual auth files, shows you the patterns]
```

**Drop Inbox Magic:**
- Drop files into `~/Documents/claude-code-buddy-knowledge/`
- CCB automatically indexes them every 5 seconds
- Supports: .md, .txt, .json, .pdf, .docx
- No commands needed - just drop and done!

**Knowledge Graph**
```
You: "Why did we choose this architecture?"
CCB: [Recalls the decision, the alternatives considered, and the tradeoffs]
```

**Project Context**
```
CCB remembers:
- Your coding standards
- Naming conventions
- Project-specific patterns
- What you've already built
```

### 💰 Smart Model Selection & Cost Savings

CCB analyzes task complexity and routes to the optimal Claude model, saving ~40% on token costs:

- **Haiku** (simple/cheap) - Quick tasks like code formatting, simple bug fixes
- **Sonnet** (balanced) - Standard development work, code reviews
- **Opus** (complex/quality) - Architecture design, complex debugging

**How it works**: TaskAnalyzer examines your request → Estimates complexity → Routes to the most cost-effective model → You get quality results without overpaying for simple tasks.

**Real example**: "Fix this typo" uses Haiku ($0.001), "Design authentication system" uses Opus ($0.015), "Review this PR" uses Sonnet ($0.003).

### 🤝 User-Friendly Commands

```bash
# Natural language commands that just work
buddy do setup authentication
buddy do optimize this database query
buddy stats week
buddy remember how we implemented login
buddy help
```

**Aliases work too:** `help-with`, `execute`, `recall`, `dashboard` - pick what feels natural.

### 💾 Beginner-Friendly Git Assistant

**No Git commands needed.** Just tell CCB what you want in plain language:

```bash
# Save your work
git-save-work "added login feature"

# See your versions
git-list-versions

# Go back to a previous version
git-go-back 3

# Show what changed
git-show-changes
```

**8 Git tools that speak human:**
- `git-save-work` - Save with friendly commit message
- `git-list-versions` - List recent versions
- `git-status` - Current status in readable format
- `git-show-changes` - See what changed
- `git-go-back` - Time travel to previous versions
- `git-create-backup` - Create local backup
- `git-setup` - Setup Git for new projects
- `git-help` - Show available commands

**Perfect for:** Beginners who find Git intimidating, or anyone who wants simple version control.

### 🔄 Intelligent Workflow Guidance

**CCB knows what's next.** After you write code, it suggests running tests. After tests pass, it suggests code review. No manual thinking required.

```
You write code → CCB: "Code looks good! Run tests next?"
Tests pass → CCB: "Tests green! Ready for code review?"
Review done → CCB: "Review complete! Commit and push?"
```

**4 workflow tools:**
- `get-workflow-guidance` - Get next-step recommendations
- `get-session-health` - Check session health status
- `reload-context` - Reload CLAUDE.md when needed
- `record-token-usage` - Track token consumption

**Benefits:** Never wonder "what should I do next?" - CCB guides you through the complete development flow.

### 📋 Smart Implementation Planning

**Break down complex features into bite-sized tasks.** CCB generates TDD-structured plans with agent-aware task breakdown.

```
You: "Plan implementation for user authentication"
CCB: [Generates step-by-step plan with:
  - Test-first approach
  - 2-5 minute tasks
  - Right agent for each task
  - Clear success criteria]
```

**Planning tool:**
- `generate-smart-plan` - Create intelligent implementation plans

## What CCB Does Well ✅

- **Makes Claude Code context-aware** for your specific project
- **Reduces repetitive prompting** through intelligent task routing
- **Remembers between sessions** with persistent memory systems (RAG + Knowledge Graph + Project Context)
- **Provides specialized expertise** without you writing expert prompts
- **Saves token costs** by routing to optimal Claude models (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)
- **Learns from your choices** when you override agent recommendations
- **Guides your workflow** with intelligent next-step recommendations
- **Coordinates complex workflows** across multiple steps
- **Cross-platform support** works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Production-ready** with comprehensive testing, security hardening, and resource protection

## Honest Limitations ⚠️

- **Not magic** - Still needs clear requirements from you
- **Not a replacement for learning** - You should understand what you're building
- **Enhances Claude Code, doesn't replace it** - Works alongside your existing setup
- **Requires setup** - 2-minute install, not one-click (yet)
- **Early stage (v2.0)** - Expect rough edges, but actively improving
- **Limited by Claude's capabilities** - Can't make Claude do impossible things

**Philosophy:** We're honest about what works and what doesn't. If something doesn't work for you, let us know - that feedback makes it better for everyone.
