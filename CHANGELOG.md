  - Automated MCP server configuration
  - Full customization via natural conversation with Claude Code
  - Comprehensive installation guide: `docs/guides/CLAUDE_CODE_INSTALLATION.md`
  - Setup time reduced from 15-20 minutes to 2-5 minutes
  - Users can modify agents, create skills, update config - all through Claude Code
- **MCP Server Integration**: Full integration with Claude Code via Model Context Protocol
  - MCP setup verification tools and example config
  - MCP server integration guide and comprehensive documentation
  - Resources capability in MCP server initialization
- **Development Butler**: Event-driven development automation agent
  - Checkpoint detection system for workflow events
  - Integration with Claude Code hooks
  - Core agent implementation
- **Test Writer Agent**: Automated test generation capabilities
- **DevOps Engineer Agent**: CI/CD configuration and automation
- **Agent Classification System**: Enhanced AgentRegistry with agent categorization
- **MCP Tool Interface**: Agent-tool interaction layer for seamless integration
- **Evolution Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring and analytics (`evolution_dashboard` tool)
- **Permission-based UX**: Enhanced security and user control in integration

### Changed
- **Agent Count**: Reduced from 22 to 13 agents for better maintainability
  - 5 real implementations, 7 enhanced prompts, 1 optional feature
  - New categorization: Development (3), Operations (2), Management (2), Engineering (2), Analysis (2), Creative (1), Business (1)
- **Test Coverage**: 447 passing tests (unit, integration, E2E, regression)
- **Architecture Simplification**: Removed unused features and simplified to Claude + OpenAI only
- **RAG Configuration**: OpenAI embeddings as primary, HuggingFace as optional alternative

### Fixed
- MCP server verification check improvements
- Agent count test expectations updated to match V2.1 reality (13 agents)
- Filesystem and memory helpers added to MCPToolInterface
- Environment variable loading for RAG with OpenAI API key
- **Test Suite Fixes** (2025-12-30):
  - Fixed MCPToolInterface test to correctly validate v2.1.0 behavior (prompt enhancement mode)
  - Fixed evolution-regression cost tracking test: Added MicroDollars to dollars conversion using `toDollars()` utility
  - Fixed AgentRouter MicroDollars formatting bug: Properly convert μUSD to dollars before display
  - Root cause: Type confusion between MicroDollars (integer μUSD) and dollars (float)
  - Prevention: Always use `toDollars()` utility from `src/utils/money.ts` for display/comparison
  - Test suite now passing: 447/447 tests (100% pass rate)

### Refactored
- **Evolution Storage Layer** (Phase 1-3 refactoring)
  - Phase 1: Critical security fixes
    - Eliminated SQL injection vulnerabilities in FTS queries
    - Hardened all database query parameters
    - Improved error handling and validation
  - Phase 2: Major improvements
    - Implemented proper TypeScript type safety with branded MicroDollars type
    - Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation for core utilities
    - Created safeJsonParse utility for robust JSON handling
    - Enhanced null safety throughout storage layer
  - Phase 3: Minor improvements
    - Eliminated all 51 'as any' type casts in SQLiteStore implementations
    - Added JSDoc documentation to 8+ core public API methods
    - Replaced magic numbers with named constants (money formatting)
    - Standardized null handling patterns (|| null for inserts, ?? undefined for reads)

### Documentation
