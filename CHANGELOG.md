## [Unreleased]

## [2.8.0] - 2026-02-08

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **MCP Tool Naming Unification** - All non-core tools now use `memesh-*` prefix for better discoverability
  - `buddy-record-mistake` → `memesh-record-mistake`
  - `create-entities` → `memesh-create-entities`
  - `buddy-secret-store` → `memesh-secret-store`
  - `buddy-secret-get` → `memesh-secret-get`
  - `buddy-secret-list` → `memesh-secret-list`
  - `buddy-secret-delete` → `memesh-secret-delete`
  - `hook-tool-use` → `memesh-hook-tool-use`
  - `generate-tests` → `memesh-generate-tests`

  **Migration**: Old names still work via aliases with deprecation warnings. Aliases will be removed in v3.0.0. See [UPGRADE.md](docs/UPGRADE.md#v280) for migration guide.

### Added

- **Vector Semantic Search** - Find memories by meaning, not just keywords
  - `buddy-remember` now supports `mode` parameter: `semantic`, `keyword`, `hybrid` (default)
  - `minSimilarity` parameter to filter low-quality matches (0-1 threshold)
  - Uses all-MiniLM-L6-v2 ONNX model (384 dimensions, runs 100% locally)
  - Automatic embedding generation when creating entities
  - Backfill script for existing entities: `npm run backfill-embeddings`

- **Alias System** - Backward compatibility for renamed tools
  - Deprecated tool names show migration warnings
  - Smooth transition path to v3.0.0

### Removed

- **A2A Local Collaboration Features** - Simplified to Local-first architecture
  - Removed 35 A2A-related files and modules
  - Removed agent-to-agent communication (daemon, socket server, distributed task queue)
  - Removed A2A inbox, session coordination, and multi-agent orchestration
  - Focus on single-agent local memory management
  - **Reason**: Local-first architecture simplifies codebase and aligns with MCP specification

### Changed

- **Tool Count**: 18 → **12 tools** (3 buddy commands + 8 memesh tools + 1 cloud sync)
  - Core tools preserved: `buddy-do`, `buddy-remember`, `buddy-help`
  - Feature tools unified under `memesh-*` namespace

### Technical

- New `src/embeddings/` module with ModelManager, EmbeddingService, VectorExtension
- Added sqlite-vec for vector KNN search
- Added onnxruntime-node for ONNX inference
- Added @xenova/transformers for tokenization
- Added chokidar for file watching
- Integration tests for full semantic search flow
- Enhanced MCPToolDefinition interface with aliases field
- ToolRouter with alias resolution and deprecation warnings

### Documentation

- **Major documentation update**: Corrected all outdated installation guides
  - Fixed QUICK_INSTALL.md: Completely rewritten with correct installation priority (npm global install first)
  - Updated tool count: 18 tools → **12 tools** (accurate count with complete list)
  - Added deprecation notices for renamed tools in all documentation
  - Updated troubleshooting guide with common issues and solutions (PR #52)
  - Removed misleading Plugin Installation instructions (--plugin-dir flag)
  - Removed Cursor and VS Code installation instructions (not officially supported)
  - Updated README.md, GETTING_STARTED.md, and guides/QUICK_START.md for consistency
  - Corrected installation method: MCP Server mode (auto-configures mcp_settings.json), not Plugin mode
  - Added v2.8.0 migration guide in UPGRADE.md
