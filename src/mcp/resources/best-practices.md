# Smart-Agents Best Practices

**Version**: 0.1.0

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. Let the System Learn

**❌ Don't**:
- Force specific agents for every task
- Bypass the smart router constantly
- Ignore evolution suggestions

**✅ Do**:
- Use `sa_task` and let the router choose
- Review evolution dashboard regularly
- Trust the learned patterns
- Provide feedback when results are unexpected

**Why**: The system improves with usage. The more you use the smart router, the better it gets at routing.

---

### 2. Write Clear, Descriptive Tasks

**❌ Don't**:
```bash
sa_task "fix bug"
sa_task "add feature"
sa_task "make it faster"
```

**✅ Do**:
```bash
sa_task "fix authentication bug where JWT tokens expire immediately after login"
sa_task "add email verification to user registration with 24-hour expiry"
sa_task "optimize dashboard SQL query reducing load time from 5s to under 1s"
```

**Why**: Specific descriptions help the router select the best agent and provide better context for execution.

---

### 3. Provide Context

**❌ Don't**:
```bash
sa_task "review code"  # Which code? What aspects?
```

**✅ Do**:
```bash
sa_task "review UserController.ts focusing on security vulnerabilities, input validation, and error handling"
```

**Why**: Context enables more focused and valuable agent work.

## 📋 Task Description Guidelines

### Structure of a Good Task Description

```
[Action] + [Target] + [Context/Requirements]
```

**Examples**:

| Action | Target | Context | Full Task |
|--------|--------|---------|-----------|
| debug | login endpoint | timeout after password check | debug login endpoint timeout occurring after password verification step |
| implement | user search | pagination and filters | implement user search API with pagination, name filter, and role filter |
| optimize | dashboard query | reduce from 5s to 1s | optimize dashboard analytics query currently taking 5s with N+1 problem |
| review | payment integration | security and edge cases | review Stripe payment integration for security issues and edge case handling |

---

### Include Constraints and Requirements

**❌ Vague**:
```bash
sa_task "add caching"
```

**✅ Specific**:
```bash
sa_task "add Redis caching to product API with 5-minute TTL and cache invalidation on product updates"
```

**Include**:
- Performance targets
- Security requirements
- Error handling expectations
- Edge cases to consider
- Business rules

---

## 🔄 Workflow Best Practices

### Feature Development Sequence

**Recommended Flow**:
1. **Design** (api-designer / architecture-agent)
2. **Implement** (frontend-specialist / backend-specialist)
3. **Test** (test-writer)
4. **Review** (code-reviewer)
5. **Deploy** (devops-engineer)

**Example**:
```bash
sa_task "design API endpoints for blog post management (CRUD operations)"
sa_task "implement blog post API with validation, authentication, and authorization"
sa_task "write comprehensive tests for blog API covering CRUD, auth, and edge cases"
sa_task "review blog API code for security, performance, and best practices"
sa_task "set up CI/CD pipeline for blog service deployment"
```

---

### Bug Fixing Sequence

**Recommended Flow**:
1. **Debug** (debugger)
2. **Fix** (appropriate specialist)
3. **Verify** (debugger / test-writer)
4. **Test** (test-writer)

**Example**:
```bash
sa_task "debug checkout failure where payment succeeds but order is not created"
sa_task "fix order creation race condition in payment webhook handler"
sa_task "write regression test for payment webhook race condition"
```

---

### Refactoring Sequence

**Recommended Flow**:
1. **Analyze** (code-reviewer / architecture-agent)
2. **Plan** (refactorer / architecture-agent)
3. **Implement** (refactorer)
4. **Test** (test-writer)
5. **Verify** (code-reviewer)

**Example**:
```bash
sa_task "analyze UserService class for code smells and refactoring opportunities"
sa_task "refactor UserService to separate concerns using repository pattern and service layer"
sa_task "write tests for refactored UserService maintaining 100% code coverage"
sa_task "review refactored code ensuring improved maintainability"
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Chain Related Tasks

Instead of one giant task:
```bash
❌ sa_task "implement complete user management system with registration, login, profile, password reset, email verification, and admin panel"
```

Break into logical steps:
```bash
✅ sa_task "design user management API endpoints"
✅ sa_task "implement user registration with validation"
✅ sa_task "implement login with JWT authentication"
✅ sa_task "implement profile management"
✅ sa_task "implement password reset flow"
✅ sa_task "write comprehensive tests for user management"
```

**Why**: Better agent selection, clearer results, easier debugging

---

### 2. Use Evolution Dashboard

```bash
sa_dashboard
```

**Look for**:
- Which agent sequences work best
- Success/failure patterns
- Common workflows
- Performance metrics

**Adjust based on**:
- High-success patterns → repeat them
- Low-success patterns → modify approach
- Unused agents → explore new use cases

---

### 3. Keyword Optimization

Use keywords that trigger the right agent:

| Goal | Keywords to Include |
|------|---------------------|
| Code Review | review, audit, security, best practices |
| Testing | test, coverage, TDD, unit test, integration |
| Debugging | debug, error, bug, trace, investigate |
| Optimization | optimize, performance, slow, improve speed |
| Refactoring | refactor, clean up, patterns, improve structure |
| Design | design, architecture, API, endpoints, schema |

---

### 4. Provide Success Criteria

**❌ Vague**:
```bash
sa_task "improve performance"
```

**✅ Clear Success Criteria**:
```bash
sa_task "improve homepage load time from 3s to under 1s measured by Lighthouse performance score"
```

**Benefits**:
- Agent knows when task is complete
- Clear verification method
- Evolution system learns what "success" means

---

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Over-Specifying Agent

**❌ Don't**:
```bash
# Forcing wrong agent via direct tool call
code-reviewer "write unit tests"  # Wrong! Use test-writer
```

**✅ Do**:
```bash
sa_task "write unit tests for authentication"  # Let router choose
```

---

### 2. Under-Describing Context

**❌ Don't**:
```bash
sa_task "fix the thing"
sa_task "add that feature we discussed"
```

**✅ Do**:
```bash
sa_task "fix race condition in order creation where concurrent requests create duplicate orders"
sa_task "add dark mode toggle to settings page with localStorage persistence"
```

---

### 3. Ignoring Evolution Patterns

**❌ Don't**:
- Manually route every task
- Ignore dashboard suggestions
- Skip pattern review

**✅ Do**:
- Check `sa_dashboard` regularly
- Notice successful patterns
- Adapt workflow based on learning

---

### 4. Batch Unrelated Tasks

**❌ Don't**:
```bash
sa_task "implement login, fix checkout bug, optimize database, and write documentation"
```

**✅ Do**:
```bash
sa_task "implement JWT-based login with refresh tokens"
sa_task "debug checkout payment processing timeout"
sa_task "optimize product search query with proper indexes"
sa_task "write API documentation for user endpoints"
```
