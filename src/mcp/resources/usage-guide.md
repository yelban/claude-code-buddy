## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Use Descriptive Task Descriptions

❌ Bad:
```
sa_task "fix bug"
```

✅ Good:
```
sa_task "fix the authentication bug where users can't login after password reset"
```

### 2. Specify Context When Needed

```
sa_task "review the UserController.ts file for security vulnerabilities, focusing on SQL injection and XSS"
```

### 3. Leverage the Smart Router

Let the system choose the best agent:
```
sa_task "optimize database queries"
```

The router will automatically select `db-optimizer` based on keywords.

### 4. Check Evolution Dashboard

```
sa_dashboard
```

See which agents are performing well and learn from patterns.

## 🔄 Workflow Examples

### Feature Development Workflow

```
1. sa_task "design API endpoints for user management"  → api-designer
2. sa_task "implement user registration with validation" → backend-specialist
3. sa_task "write tests for user registration"          → test-writer
4. sa_task "review user management code"                 → code-reviewer
```

### Bug Fix Workflow

```
1. sa_task "debug login timeout issue"                   → debugger
2. sa_task "optimize login query performance"            → db-optimizer
3. sa_task "write regression test for login timeout"     → test-writer
```

### Refactoring Workflow

```
1. sa_task "analyze current architecture for scalability" → architecture-agent
2. sa_task "refactor monolith to microservices"          → refactorer
3. sa_task "set up CI/CD for microservices"               → devops-engineer
4. sa_task "performance test the new architecture"        → performance-profiler
```

## 📊 Evolution System

### How It Works

1. **Pattern Learning**: System learns which agent sequences work best
2. **Auto-Routing**: Improved suggestions based on your patterns
3. **Performance Tracking**: Monitors success rates
4. **Adaptation**: Adjusts recommendations over time

### Viewing Progress

```
sa_dashboard
```

- Success rates
- Common workflows
- Performance metrics

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### 1. Combine Agents for Complex Tasks

```
sa_task "research best database for real-time chat, then design the schema"
```

System may route to: research-agent → db-optimizer

### 2. Use Specific Keywords

- "review" → code-reviewer
- "test" → test-writer
- "debug" → debugger
- "refactor" → refactorer
- "design API" → api-designer
- "optimize query" → db-optimizer

### 3. View All Available Agents

```
sa_agents --category development
sa_agents --category analysis
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Working as Expected

1. Check task description clarity
2. Try more specific keywords
3. Manually specify agent if needed (direct tool call)
4. Check evolution dashboard for patterns

### System Not Learning

- Ensure enough tasks have been completed (>10)
- Check if bootstrap data is enabled for new users
- Review success/failure metrics
