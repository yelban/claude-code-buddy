### 6.3 FAQ (10 Common Questions)

**Q1: What's the difference between smart-agents and regular Claude Code?**
A: Regular Claude Code has one AI assistant that works sequentially. Smart-agents gives you a team of specialized AI agents that can work in parallel in the background while you continue coding. Think of it as upgrading from a solo assistant to a full engineering team.

**Q2: Will background agents slow down my computer?**
A: No. Smart-agents automatically limits resource usage (70% CPU, 8GB RAM by default) and monitors system health. If resources are low, it automatically pauses background tasks or suggests foreground execution.

**Q3: How do I know which agent did what?**
A: Every action has clear attribution. Success messages show which agent completed what task and how long it took. Error messages clearly state which agent caused an issue and what went wrong.

**Q4: Can I trust the agents to work without supervision?**
A: Smart-agents is designed for transparency and control. You can monitor progress in real-time, cancel tasks anytime, and review all results. The system learns from your corrections to improve accuracy.

**Q5: What happens if an agent makes a mistake?**
A: Agents clearly report errors with explanations. For serious issues, smart-agents automatically rolls back changes and disables the problematic agent. You're always in control.

**Q6: How much faster will I be with smart-agents?**
A: Users typically see 30-50% productivity gains from running tasks in parallel. The actual benefit depends on your workflow—tasks like research, code review, and testing benefit most from background execution.

**Q7: Does smart-agents work offline?**
A: Background execution and progress tracking work offline. However, agents that require API calls (research, certain code analysis) need internet connectivity.

**Q8: Can I use smart-agents with my team?**
A: Currently smart-agents is designed for individual use. Team collaboration features (shared agent pools, collaborative queues) are coming in v2.0.

**Q9: How does the learning system work?**
A: Smart-agents tracks your choices (background vs foreground, which agents you prefer, corrections you make) and adapts suggestions over time. All learning is local—your data never leaves your machine.

**Q10: What's the cost?**
A: Smart-agents is included in Claude Code Pro subscription ($20/month). There are no additional API costs—all agents use your existing Claude API quota.

🧵 How I use smart-agents to 10x my productivity

1/ Like many devs, I used to context-switch 20+ times daily

Every time I needed to research something, I'd:
• Leave my editor
• Open browser
• Get distracted
• Lose flow

Smart-agents changed everything ↓

2/ Now I delegate research to background agents

While I code, Research Agent:
✓ Gathers docs
✓ Analyzes examples
✓ Summarizes findings

When I need it, results are ready

No context switch. No flow break.

3/ But it gets better...

Multiple agents work simultaneously:
• Research Agent → Gathers info
• Code Agent → Generates boilerplate
• QA Agent → Writes tests
• Security Agent → Audits code

All while I focus on architecture ↓

4/ The results?

Before smart-agents:
• 6-7 story points per sprint
• Constant context switching
• Burnout by Thursday

After smart-agents:
• 10-11 story points per sprint
• Deep focus for hours
• Energy left for personal projects

5/ Best part: it learns from me

When I correct an agent's work, it remembers

Next time: More accurate suggestions

It's like having a team that actually learns ↓

6/ If you're on Claude Code, try smart-agents

First background task will blow your mind

💡 Insight: AI assistants are great, but AI *teams* are game-changing

After 3 months with smart-agents, I've learned:

1️⃣ Parallel > Sequential
Running 5 agents in parallel beats 1 agent doing 5 tasks

2️⃣ Specialization > Generalization
Research Agent beats general AI at research
Code Review Agent beats general AI at review

3️⃣ Transparent > Black Box
Knowing which agent did what builds trust
Clear attribution enables accountability

4️⃣ Adaptive > Static
Agents that learn from corrections beat rigid rules

The future of AI-assisted development isn't bigger models.
It's smarter collaboration.

**Reddit r/programming Post**

Title: I built an AI agent system that 3x'd my code review speed [Smart-Agents]

Body:

Hey r/programming,

I've been using Claude Code's new smart-agents feature for 2 months.
The productivity gain is insane, so I wanted to share.

**The Problem:**
Code reviews took me 2-3 hours per PR. By the time I finished, I'd
lost context on what I was building.

**The Solution:**
Smart-agents lets me run specialized agents in background:
- Code Review Agent: Catches bugs, style issues
- Security Agent: Finds vulnerabilities
- Performance Agent: Suggests optimizations

While they work, I keep coding. Zero context switch.

**The Results:**
- Review time: 2-3 hours → 30 minutes
- Issues found: 60% → 95%
- Reviews feel less like chores

**How it works:**
[Screenshot of agent coordination]

Multiple agents work in parallel, each with their specialty.
Results aggregate into one comprehensive review.

**Downsides:**
- Requires Claude Code Pro ($20/month)
- Learning curve for optimal agent selection
- Occasionally suggests false positives

**Overall:**
This is the biggest productivity boost I've had since switching to VSCode.

Happy to answer questions!

### 9.3 Misleading Productivity Metrics Scenario

**Situation**: Users report productivity metrics are inflated/inaccurate

**Response**:

**Acknowledgment** (blog post):
```
Title: Improving Smart-Agents Productivity Metrics

We've heard feedback that our productivity metrics (time saved,
tasks completed) sometimes feel inflated.

You're right. Here's what's happening:

Current calculation:
"Time saved" = estimated task duration - actual agent duration

Problem:
• Estimates are often conservative
• Doesn't account for tasks you wouldn't have done
• Can't measure "flow state" preservation

What we're changing:

1. More realistic baselines
   • Use your historical data
   • Account for task you'd skip

2. New metrics
   • "Context switches avoided"
   • "Deep work time preserved"
   • "Parallelism gain"

3. Transparency
   • Show calculation method
   • Let you adjust estimates
   • Raw data always available

Timeline:
• v1.6 (next week): Calculation transparency
• v1.7 (2 weeks): New metrics
• v1.8 (1 month): Personalized baselines

We want metrics you trust. Feedback welcome.

[Email us] [Join discussion]
```

**In-App Update**:
```
📊 Productivity Metrics Update

We've improved how we calculate "time saved":

Old method:
Estimated duration - actual duration

New method:
Your historical speed - agent speed
(More accurate to YOUR workflow)

Why?
You told us metrics felt inflated. We listened.

## 11. Voice & Tone Guidelines

### 11.1 Brand Voice Attributes

**Core Characteristics**:
- **Authentic**: Genuine, not corporate-speak
- **Empowering**: You're in control, we're your tool
- **Transparent**: Honest about what works (and doesn't)
- **Collaborative**: Working together, not AI replacing you
- **Knowledgeable**: Technical depth when needed, simple when not

**Not**:
- ❌ Overly technical (no unnecessary jargon)
- ❌ Hype-driven ("Revolutionary!", "Game-changing!")
- ❌ Condescending ("Obviously...", "Just...")
- ❌ Apologetic without action ("Sorry, sorry, sorry...")
- ❌ Robotic (corporate templates, no personality)

### 11.2 Tone by Context

| **Onboarding** | Friendly guide | "Let's run your first background task together" |
| **Crisis** | Transparent and calm | "We're aware of the issue. Here's what we know and what we're doing." |
| **Education** | Expert but accessible | "Background agents work best for tasks that take 5+ minutes" |
| **Metrics** | Empowering not bragging | "You shipped 3 features this week—40% more than usual" |

### 11.3 Writing Principles

**Clarity**:
- Use short sentences (avg. 15-20 words)
- One idea per sentence
- Active voice preferred ("Agent completed task" vs "Task was completed")

**Conciseness**:
- Eliminate fluff ("in order to" → "to")
- Get to the point quickly
- Respect user time

**Accessibility**:
- Explain technical terms on first use
- Provide examples
- Use visuals when helpful

**Consistency**:
- Smart-agents (capitalized, hyphenated)
- Agent names: "Research Agent" (capitalized)
- Execution modes: "background" or "foreground" (lowercase)
- Features: "Pro" (capitalized when referring to tier)
