# Getting Started with MeMesh

**Install Time**: 2 minutes • **First Memory**: 30 seconds • **Ready to Code**: Immediately

---

## What is MeMesh?

**MeMesh gives Claude Code a persistent memory.** Simple as that.

Every project you work on, every decision you make, every bug you fix—Claude remembers it all. No more re-explaining your architecture every session. No more "As I mentioned earlier..." No more starting from scratch.

### What You Get

✅ **Remembers Everything**: Architecture decisions, design patterns, bugs fixed, conventions used
✅ **Smart Task Routing**: Automatically detects what kind of work you need and applies the right expertise
✅ **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
✅ **100% Local**: Your code and decisions never leave your machine

### Before and After

**❌ Without MeMesh:**
```
Session 1: "We use JWT for auth..."
Session 2: "Remember our auth?"
Claude: "Sorry, no context..."
You: *explains everything again* 😤
```

**✅ With MeMesh:**
```
Session 1: "Setup JWT auth"
Session 2: "Remember auth"
MeMesh: "JWT auth from Jan 15: 15min access tokens, 7-day refresh..."
```

**Best for**: Contributing or customizing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PCIRCLE-AI/claude-code-buddy.git
cd claude-code-buddy
npm install
npm run build
```

**Configure MCP** in `~/.claude.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memesh": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/claude-code-buddy/dist/mcp/server-bootstrap.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Automatic Setup

The quick install script automatically:
- ✅ Checks Node.js 20+ is installed
- ✅ Installs dependencies
- ✅ Builds the project
- ✅ Shows activation command

**No config files to edit. No API keys to find. Just install and go.**

## Verify It's Working

### 1. Check MeMesh is Active

In Claude Code, run:
```bash
buddy-help
```

**Expected output:**
```
MeMesh v2.6 - Persistent Memory for Claude Code

Available Commands:
  buddy-do <task>        - Execute any development task
  buddy-remember <query> - Recall project decisions and patterns
  buddy-help            - Show this help

  get-session-health    - Check token usage and session state
  get-workflow-guidance - Get recommendations for current phase
  generate-tests <file> - Auto-generate comprehensive tests

Status: ✅ Connected (7 tools available)
```

### 2. Test Memory Storage

Try this:
```bash
"Store this decision: We're using PostgreSQL for JSONB support"
```

Then recall it:
```bash
buddy-remember "database choice"
```

**You should see:** Your stored decision retrieved from memory.

### 3. Test Task Routing

```bash
buddy-do "review this function for security issues:
function login(user, pass) {
  return db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE name=' + user);
}"
```

**You should see:** Security analysis identifying SQL injection vulnerability.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>❌ "MCP server not found"</strong></summary>

**Cause**: Claude Code can't connect to MeMesh

**Fix**:
1. Verify installation path is correct:
   ```bash
   cd claude-code-buddy
   pwd  # Copy this path
   ```

2. Check the file exists:
   ```bash
   ls dist/mcp/server-bootstrap.js
   ```

3. Rebuild if missing:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Restart Claude Code completely

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>❌ "Commands don't respond"</strong></summary>

**Cause**: MeMesh server isn't running or crashed

**Fix**:
1. Check server logs:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.claude/logs/memesh.log
   ```

2. Verify Node.js version:
   ```bash
   node --version  # Should be v20.0.0+
   ```

3. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd claude-code-buddy
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

4. Restart Claude Code

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>❌ "Installation succeeded but nothing happens"</strong></summary>

**Cause**: Plugin directory not loaded

**Fix**:
1. Start Claude Code with plugin flag:
   ```bash
   claude --plugin-dir /path/to/claude-code-buddy
   ```

2. Create shell alias for convenience:
   ```bash
   # Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
   alias claude-mem='claude --plugin-dir /path/to/claude-code-buddy'
   ```

3. For team distribution, create a [Plugin Marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces)

## Your First Commands

### Store and Retrieve

**Store a decision:**
```bash
"Remember: We chose React over Vue because the team knows React better"
```

**Retrieve it later:**
```bash
buddy-remember "why React?"
```

**Expected**: Instant recall of your decision with the reasoning.

### Smart Task Routing

**Code review:**
```bash
buddy-do "review src/auth.ts for security"
```

**Generate tests:**
```bash
generate-tests "src/utils/validation.ts"
```

**Refactor code:**
```bash
buddy-do "refactor UserService to reduce duplication"
```

**Each command automatically routes to the right internal capability with the right expertise.**

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Joining an Existing Project

**You**: New to the project, need to understand decisions

```bash
# Query project memory
buddy-remember "architecture decisions"
buddy-remember "why PostgreSQL"
buddy-remember "authentication approach"

# Get overview
buddy-do "summarize the key technical decisions in this project"
```

**Result**: Instant context on why things are the way they are.

---

### Scenario 2: Starting a New Project

**You**: Fresh start, want to track decisions from day one

```bash
# Make initial decisions and store them
"Remember: Using TypeScript strict mode for type safety"
"Remember: Chose Express over Fastify for ecosystem maturity"
"Remember: Using Vitest for testing because it's fast and ESM-native"

# Later in the project
buddy-remember "testing framework"
```

**Result**: Your decisions are preserved forever. New team members can query them months later.

---

### Scenario 3: Debugging a Recurring Issue

**You**: Bug keeps coming back, want to track the fix

```bash
# Debug and document
buddy-do "analyze why users are logged out randomly"

# After fixing
"Remember: Random logout bug was caused by JWT expiry not being refreshed.
Fixed in auth/middleware.ts by adding token refresh logic."

# Next time it happens
buddy-remember "logout bug"
```

**Result**: Root cause analysis is stored. If the bug returns, you have the full history.

## Why It Works

**MeMesh operates on three principles:**

1. **Memory First**: Every significant action is recorded automatically
2. **Smart Routing**: Tasks are routed to specialized capabilities
3. **Zero Friction**: No configuration, no API keys, no setup ceremony

**The result**: Claude Code that remembers your project like a teammate, not a tool.
