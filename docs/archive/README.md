# Documentation Archive

**Purpose**: This directory contains historical documentation that is no longer actively maintained but preserved for reference and context.

---

## 📋 Archival Policy

### What Gets Archived?

Documentation is archived (not deleted) when:

1. **Superseded by newer docs** - Content has been consolidated into updated documentation
2. **Point-in-time snapshots** - Session summaries, status reports from specific dates
3. **One-time analyses** - Audits, assessments completed and documented
4. **Completed initiatives** - Project phases or features that are finished

### What Stays Active?

Documentation stays active when:

1. **Reference material** - Frequently consulted for development
2. **Living documents** - Updated as project evolves
3. **Guides and tutorials** - Actively used by developers
4. **API documentation** - Current system interfaces
