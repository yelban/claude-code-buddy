                    ▼         ▼         ▼
              ┌─────────┐ ┌────────┐ ┌──────────┐
              │ Router  │ │ Memory │ │ Semantic  │
              │         │ │ Graph  │ │ Search    │
              └─────────┘ └────────┘ └──────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- Local-first: All data stored locally, never transmitted
- Zero configuration: Works out of the box
- Vector semantic search: ONNX embeddings for intelligent recall
- Persistent memory: Knowledge graph persists across sessions

## Core Commands

### buddy-do

**Purpose**: Execute tasks with memory-enhanced context

**Syntax**:
```
buddy-do "<task description>"
```

**How it works**:
1. Analyzes task complexity and required capabilities
2. Routes to the best-suited capability (backend, frontend, devops, etc.)
3. Enhances prompt with project context
4. Returns routing decision and enhanced prompt

**Examples**:

```bash
# Backend development
buddy-do "implement user authentication with JWT"
# → Routes to backend-developer capability
# → Analyzes database requirements, security considerations
# → Provides enhanced prompt with project context

# Frontend development
buddy-do "create responsive navbar with dark mode toggle"
# → Routes to frontend-developer capability
# → Considers existing design system
# → Suggests component structure

# DevOps tasks
buddy-do "setup CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions"
# → Routes to devops capability
# → Analyzes deployment requirements
# → Provides workflow configuration

# Bug fixes
buddy-do "fix memory leak in user service"
# → Routes to debugging capability
# → Analyzes potential causes
# → Suggests investigation steps
```

**Task Metadata Extraction**:

buddy-do automatically extracts metadata from your task description:

- **Goal**: What you want to achieve
- **Reason**: Why you're doing this (if mentioned)
- **Expected Outcome**: What success looks like

Example:
```
buddy-do "add email verification because users need to confirm accounts"

Extracted:
- Goal: "add email verification"
- Reason: "users need to confirm accounts"
- Expected Outcome: (inferred from context)
```

**Response Structure**:

```
✓ BUDDY-DO SUCCESS

📋 Task
Setup user authentication with JWT

────────────────────────────────────

✓ Results
  routing:
    approved: true
    message: Task routed to backend-developer

### buddy-remember

**Purpose**: Store and recall knowledge from your project's memory graph

**Syntax**:
```bash
# Store knowledge
buddy-remember "<information to store>"

# Recall knowledge (search)
buddy-remember "<search query>"
```

**How it works**:

**Storage Mode**:
- Detects when you're providing information (not a question)
- Stores in Knowledge Graph with auto-generated tags
- Records timestamp and context
- Returns confirmation

**Recall Mode**:
- Searches Knowledge Graph by keywords and semantic similarity
- Ranks results by relevance
- Returns matching memories with context
- Suggests next steps if no results found

**Storage Examples**:

```bash
# Store decisions
buddy-remember "We decided to use PostgreSQL because it supports JSON and has better performance for complex queries"

# Store patterns
buddy-remember "All API endpoints follow RESTful conventions with /api/v1 prefix"

# Store lessons learned
buddy-remember "Login bug was caused by session timeout not being reset on activity. Fixed by updating session middleware"

# Store configuration
buddy-remember "Production uses AWS RDS with t3.medium instances, staging uses t3.micro"
```

**Recall Examples**:

```bash
# Search for decisions
buddy-remember "why did we choose PostgreSQL?"
# → Returns: Database selection decisions and reasons

# Find patterns
buddy-remember "API endpoint conventions"
# → Returns: RESTful patterns, versioning strategy

# Find solutions to similar problems
buddy-remember "session timeout issues"
# → Returns: Past bugs, solutions, and lessons learned

# Check configuration
buddy-remember "database configuration"
# → Returns: Database settings, connection strings (sanitized)
```

## Real-World Examples

Learn how MeMesh helps you build better software through real project scenarios. These examples demonstrate how MeMesh's persistent memory enhances your workflow across multiple sessions.

### Example 1: Building a REST API (Multi-Day Workflow)

This example shows how MeMesh remembers your architectural decisions and coding patterns across a week-long project.

#### Day 1: Initial Setup

**Your Task**: Start building a REST API for an e-commerce platform

```bash
You: buddy-do "create Express API with user authentication"
```

**What MeMesh Does**:
- Analyzes requirements (Express, authentication, API)
- Routes to backend-developer capability
- Generates complete setup:
  - Express server with middleware
  - JWT authentication system
  - User model and database schema
  - Auth routes (/login, /register, /refresh)

**MeMesh Automatically Remembers**:
```
✅ Tech stack: Express + MongoDB + JWT
✅ Coding style: RESTful, async/await, error handling middleware
✅ File structure: controllers/, models/, routes/, middleware/
✅ Authentication: JWT with 15-min access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens
```

**Store Your Decision**:
```bash
You: buddy-remember "Using JWT for authentication because we need stateless auth for mobile app and easy horizontal scaling"
```

---

#### Day 3: Adding New Features

**Your Task**: Add password reset functionality

```bash
You: buddy-do "add password reset feature"
```

**MeMesh Recalls**:
```
✅ Your auth architecture from Day 1 (JWT tokens, user model)
✅ Email service setup (from Day 2)
✅ Token generation pattern (consistent with existing auth)
```

**Result**:
- Password reset integrates seamlessly with existing auth system
- Uses same JWT library and token patterns
- Follows your established API conventions (/api/v1/auth/reset-password)
- No need to re-explain architecture

**Store the New Pattern**:
```bash
You: buddy-remember "Password reset uses time-limited JWT tokens (15 min expiry) sent via email. Tokens are single-use and invalidated after use."
```

---

#### Day 7: Query Past Decisions

**Your Task**: New team member asks about auth implementation

```bash
You: buddy-remember "why JWT over sessions?"
```

**MeMesh Returns**:
```
Found 3 relevant memories:

1. [Day 1, 2026-01-15] Decision: JWT authentication
   "Using JWT for authentication because we need stateless
   auth for mobile app and easy horizontal scaling"
   Tags: authentication, jwt, architecture, decision

2. [Day 3, 2026-01-17] Pattern: Token expiration
   "JWT tokens: 15-min access, 7-day refresh. Keeps security
   tight while maintaining good UX"
   Tags: jwt, security, tokens

3. [Day 4, 2026-01-18] Lesson: Token refresh
   "Implemented silent refresh. Frontend checks token expiry
   and refreshes 5 minutes before expiration"
   Tags: jwt, frontend, refresh-token
```

**Benefit**: Complete context retrieved in seconds, no digging through Git history or Slack messages.

---

#### Day 10: Bug Fix with Context

**Your Task**: Login fails on mobile app

```bash
You: buddy-remember "mobile authentication"
You: buddy-do "investigate mobile login failures"
```

**MeMesh Uses**:
- Remembers mobile-specific requirements (from Day 1)
- Recalls auth flow implementation (from Day 1-3)
- Checks for related past bugs (searches memory graph)

**Finds the Issue**: Cookie settings incompatible with mobile WebView

**Store the Solution**:
```bash
You: buddy-remember "Mobile login bug: Cookie sameSite attribute must be 'none' for mobile WebView. Fixed by updating Express session config."
```

---

### Example 2: Frontend Development with Design System

**Day 1: Setting Up the Design System**

```bash
You: buddy-do "create design system with Tailwind and component library"
```

**MeMesh Generates**:
- Tailwind configuration with custom colors
- Base component library (Button, Input, Card)
- Typography scale
- Spacing system

**Store Design Decisions**:
```bash
You: buddy-remember "Design system uses 8px spacing scale. Primary color: #3B82F6 (blue-500). Components follow atomic design: atoms → molecules → organisms"
```

---

**Day 4: Building Feature Components**

```bash
You: buddy-do "create product card component with image, title, price, and add-to-cart button"
```

**MeMesh Recalls**:
```
✅ Design system spacing scale (8px grid)
✅ Primary color (#3B82F6)
✅ Existing Button component (reusable)
✅ Component structure pattern (atomic design)
```

**Result**:
- Product card follows established patterns
- Uses existing Button component
- Matches spacing and color scheme
- No style inconsistencies

---

**Day 8: Responsive Design**

```bash
You: buddy-remember "responsive breakpoints"
```

**MeMesh Returns**:
```
Found 2 relevant memories:

1. [Day 2] Configuration: Tailwind breakpoints
   "Using default Tailwind breakpoints: sm (640px),
   md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)"
   Tags: tailwind, responsive, config

2. [Day 5] Pattern: Mobile-first approach
   "All components built mobile-first, then enhanced
   for larger screens using md: and lg: prefixes"
   Tags: responsive, mobile-first, pattern
```

**Apply Consistently**: Now you know exactly how to make the new component responsive.

---

### Example 3: DevOps and Infrastructure

**Day 1: Setting Up CI/CD**

```bash
You: buddy-do "setup GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline"
```

**Store Infrastructure Decisions**:
```bash
You: buddy-remember "Using GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Workflow: lint → test → build → deploy to Vercel. Runs on pull requests and main branch merges."
```

---

**Day 5: Adding Environment Variables**

```bash
You: buddy-remember "deployment configuration"
You: buddy-do "add database URL environment variable to deployment"
```

**MeMesh Recalls**:
- CI/CD workflow structure
- Vercel deployment setup
- Existing environment variable pattern

**Adds Variable Correctly**: Uses GitHub Secrets, updates Vercel config, follows naming convention.

---

**Week 2: Troubleshooting Deployment**

```bash
You: buddy-remember "CI/CD issues"
```

**MeMesh Returns**:
```
Found 1 relevant memory:

[Day 8] Lesson: Build cache issue

## Memory System

### Knowledge Graph Architecture

MeMesh uses a graph-based knowledge storage system:

```
    ┌─────────────┐
    │  Entities   │  (Users, APIs, Technologies, etc.)
    └──────┬──────┘
           │
           │ has properties
           │
    ┌──────▼──────┐
    │ Properties  │  (name, type, metadata)
    └──────┬──────┘
           │
           │ connected by
           │
    ┌──────▼──────┐
    │  Relations  │  (USES, DEPENDS_ON, CREATED_BY)
    └─────────────┘
```

### Entity Types

**Automatic Classification**:
- `Decision`: Architecture choices, technology selections
- `Pattern`: Code patterns, conventions, standards
- `Lesson`: Bug fixes, learnings, best practices
- `Configuration`: Settings, environment variables
- `Technology`: Tools, frameworks, libraries
- `Feature`: Application features, capabilities
- `Bug`: Issues, problems, error cases
- `Person`: Team members, stakeholders
- `Project`: Projects, repositories, systems

### Relationship Types

- `USES`: Entity A uses Entity B
- `DEPENDS_ON`: Entity A depends on Entity B
- `CREATED_BY`: Entity A created by Entity B
- `RELATES_TO`: General relationship
- `PART_OF`: Entity A is part of Entity B

### Auto-Tracking (Phase 0.6)

**Task Start Tracking**:
When you use `buddy-do`, MeMesh automatically records:
- Task description
- Goal (extracted)
- Reason (if provided)
- Expected outcome (if mentioned)
- Start timestamp

**Memory Linking**:
Memories created during a task are automatically linked to that task.

**Example**:
```bash
buddy-do "implement login feature because users need authentication"

# Auto-tracked:
{
  task: "implement login feature",
  goal: "implement login feature",
  reason: "users need authentication",
  timestamp: "2026-01-20T10:00:00Z"
}

# Later memories automatically linked:
buddy-remember "Using bcrypt for password hashing"
# → Links to login feature task
```

---

## Task Execution

### How Task Execution Works

**1. Task Analysis**:
```
Input: "setup user authentication with JWT"

Analysis:
- Complexity: Medium (~2500 tokens)
- Domain: Backend development
- Required capabilities: [authentication, backend, database]
- Keywords: [authentication, JWT, user, setup]
```

**2. Capability Matching**:
```
Available capabilities:
- backend-developer: 90% match (authentication, database)
- frontend-developer: 20% match (user interface)
- devops: 30% match (deployment considerations)

Selected: backend-developer (highest match)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Workflow Examples

#### Workflow 1: Starting a New Feature

```bash
# 1. Recall relevant context
buddy-remember "similar features"
buddy-remember "architectural patterns"

# 2. Plan implementation
buddy-do "plan user profile feature with avatar upload"

# 3. Execute implementation
buddy-do "implement user profile API endpoints"
buddy-do "create profile UI component"

# 4. Store decisions
buddy-remember "User profile feature uses S3 for avatar storage because it scales better"

# 5. Document patterns
buddy-remember "Profile endpoints follow /api/v1/users/:id/profile pattern"
```

#### Workflow 2: Debugging a Bug

```bash
# 1. Search for similar issues
buddy-remember "login errors"
buddy-remember "session timeout"

# 2. Analyze and fix
buddy-do "investigate why sessions expire immediately after login"

# 3. Record solution
buddy-remember "Login session bug was caused by cookie domain mismatch. Fixed by setting domain to null in session config."
```

#### Workflow 3: Code Review

```bash
# 1. Recall standards
buddy-remember "code review checklist"
buddy-remember "security best practices"

# 2. Review implementation
buddy-do "review authentication implementation for security issues"

# 3. Store findings
buddy-remember "Security review found: need rate limiting on login endpoint to prevent brute force"
```

### Integration with Other Tools

**Git Integration**:
```bash
# Store commit messages as memories
buddy-remember "feat(auth): add JWT authentication"

# Recall to maintain consistency
buddy-remember "recent authentication changes"
```

**CI/CD Integration** (Future):
```bash
# Store deployment info
buddy-remember "Deployment v1.2.3 to production on 2026-01-20, includes authentication feature"

# Query deployment history
buddy-remember "recent deployments"
```

**Testing Integration**:
```bash
# Store test results
buddy-remember "Test suite passing: 245/245 tests, coverage 87%"

# Track test patterns
buddy-remember "Authentication tests use mock JWT tokens"
```
