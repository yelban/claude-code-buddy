## Core Principles

### 1. Memory First

**Always search before creating**:
```bash
# ❌ Bad: Start working without context
buddy-do "implement login feature"

# ✅ Good: Check for existing knowledge first
buddy-remember "authentication"
buddy-remember "login implementation"
# Then work with context
buddy-do "implement login feature using our existing auth patterns"
```

**Why**: Past decisions and solutions save time and ensure consistency.

---

### 2. Store As You Work

**Record decisions immediately**:
```bash
# ❌ Bad: Wait until end of day to record
# ... work all day ...
# Try to remember what you decided

# ✅ Good: Store immediately after decision
buddy-remember "Chose bcrypt over argon2 because team familiarity and proven track record"
```

**Why**: Fresh memories are more accurate and detailed.

---

### 3. Context Over Keywords

**Provide rich context**:
```bash
# ❌ Bad: Minimal information
buddy-remember "using JWT"

# ✅ Good: Full context with reasoning
buddy-remember "Using JWT for authentication because it's stateless, scales horizontally, and works well with our microservices architecture. Token expiry set to 24 hours for security balance."
```

**Why**: Future you (and your team) will need the "why", not just the "what".

---

### 4. Progressive Complexity

**Start simple, then enhance**:
```bash
# ✅ Good: Progressive refinement
buddy-do "plan user authentication system"
# Review plan
buddy-remember "Auth system will use JWT + refresh tokens"
# Implement
buddy-do "implement JWT authentication middleware"
# Test and refine
buddy-remember "JWT middleware handles token refresh automatically"
```

**Why**: Incremental progress with knowledge capture builds better systems.

---

## Memory Management

### Storage Patterns

#### Decision Recording

**Template**:
```
We [decision] because [reason]

Example:
buddy-remember "We chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB because we need ACID transactions for financial data and have complex relational queries"
```

#### Pattern Documentation

**Template**:
```
All [entity type] follow [pattern] for [reason]

Example:
buddy-remember "All API endpoints follow /api/v1/{resource} pattern for consistent versioning and client compatibility"
```

#### Lesson Learned

**Template**:
```
[Problem] was caused by [root cause]. Fixed by [solution]

Example:
buddy-remember "Memory leak in user service was caused by unclosed database connections. Fixed by implementing connection pooling with 'pg-pool' and proper cleanup in finally blocks"
```

#### Configuration Tracking

**Template**:
```
[Environment] uses [configuration] for [purpose]

Example:
buddy-remember "Production uses AWS RDS PostgreSQL t3.large with 500GB SSD for main database, Multi-AZ for high availability"
```

---

### Search Strategies

#### Keyword Search

**Use domain terms**:
```bash
# ✅ Good: Specific domain keywords
buddy-remember "JWT token expiry policy"
buddy-remember "database migration process"
buddy-remember "error handling patterns"
```

#### Temporal Search

**Include timeframe hints**:
```bash
buddy-remember "recent authentication changes"
buddy-remember "last week's bug fixes"
buddy-remember "current API version"
```

#### Problem-Solution Search

**Frame as question or problem**:
```bash
buddy-remember "how to handle session timeout"
buddy-remember "why login fails intermittently"
buddy-remember "database connection pool sizing"
```

---

### Memory Hygiene

#### Regular Reviews

**Weekly review pattern**:
```bash
# Monday: Review last week's decisions
buddy-remember "decisions last week"

# Friday: Document this week's learnings
buddy-remember "Store summary: This week we implemented X, learned Y, decided Z"
```

#### Consolidation

**Merge related memories**:
```bash
# After several auth-related memories
buddy-remember "Authentication system overview: Uses JWT with 24h expiry, refresh tokens stored in Redis, bcrypt for passwords, rate limiting on /login"
```

#### Archival

**Mark outdated knowledge**:
```bash
buddy-remember "DEPRECATED: Old auth system used sessions. Now using JWT as of 2026-01-20"
```

---

## Effective Task Descriptions

### Task Decomposition

**Break down complex tasks**:
```bash
# ❌ Bad: Single massive task
buddy-do "implement complete user management system with auth, profiles, permissions, and admin dashboard"

# ✅ Good: Decomposed tasks
buddy-do "plan user management system architecture"
# Review plan
buddy-do "implement user authentication with JWT"
buddy-do "implement user profile CRUD operations"
buddy-do "implement role-based permissions"
buddy-do "implement admin dashboard UI"
```

**Benefits**:
- Clearer routing to specialized capabilities
- Easier to track progress
- Better context for each subtask
- More manageable complexity

---

### Task Description Quality

**Effective task descriptions**:

✅ **Good Examples**:
```bash
# Specific and goal-oriented
buddy-do "refactor user service to use dependency injection for better testability"

# Includes constraints
buddy-do "implement rate limiting middleware that allows 100 requests per minute per IP"

# Provides context
buddy-do "fix login bug where sessions expire immediately - likely related to cookie domain configuration"
```

❌ **Bad Examples**:
```bash
# Too vague
buddy-do "make the app better"

# Multiple unrelated tasks
buddy-do "fix login, add dark mode, update docs, and deploy to staging"

# Missing context
buddy-do "implement the thing we discussed"
```

---

### Capability Hints

**Guide routing with keywords**:
```bash
# Frontend-focused
buddy-do "create React component for user profile with Tailwind styling"

# Backend-focused
buddy-do "implement GraphQL API endpoint for user queries with authentication"

# DevOps-focused
buddy-do "setup GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and deployment"

# Security-focused
buddy-do "audit authentication system for security vulnerabilities and SQL injection"
```

---

## Workflow Patterns

```

---

## Team Collaboration

### Onboarding New Team Members

**Create onboarding guide**:
```bash
# Store essential information
buddy-remember "Project architecture: Microservices with React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database"

buddy-remember "Development workflow: Feature branches → PR → Code review → Staging → Production"

buddy-remember "Key conventions: API uses /api/v1 prefix, all async functions use try-catch, tests required for PRs"
```

**Share common queries**:
```bash
# New team member can search
buddy-remember "how to setup development environment"
buddy-remember "testing practices"
buddy-remember "deployment process"
```

---

### Knowledge Sharing

**Document tribal knowledge**:
```bash
buddy-remember "Why we use Redis: Session storage needs high performance, Redis provides sub-millisecond latency and automatic expiry"

buddy-remember "Production deployment checklist: 1. Run migrations, 2. Deploy backend, 3. Verify health, 4. Deploy frontend, 5. Smoke tests"

buddy-remember "Common gotchas: Database connection pool exhaustion happens under load. Monitor pool size and connection count"
```

---

### Decision Documentation

**Record team decisions**:
```bash
buddy-remember "Team decision 2026-01-20: Migrate from REST to GraphQL for flexible querying. Agreed in sprint planning, starts Q2"

buddy-remember "Architecture decision: Microservices communicate via event bus (RabbitMQ) for loose coupling and scalability"
```

---

## Performance Optimization

### Efficient Searches

**Optimize query patterns**:
```bash
# ❌ Slow: Too broad
buddy-remember "everything about auth"

# ✅ Fast: Specific keywords
buddy-remember "JWT expiry policy"
```

---

### Batch Operations

**Group related queries**:
```bash
# ❌ Inefficient: Multiple separate queries
buddy-remember "API patterns"
buddy-remember "API versioning"
buddy-remember "API error handling"

# ✅ Efficient: Combined search or comprehensive storage
buddy-remember "API conventions: RESTful /api/v1 prefix, JSON responses, standard error format {error, message, code}"
```

---

### Storage Efficiency

**Be concise but complete**:
```bash
# ❌ Too verbose
buddy-remember "So we had this really long meeting and after discussing for hours we finally decided that maybe we should probably use PostgreSQL..."

# ✅ Concise and clear
buddy-remember "Chose PostgreSQL after evaluating MongoDB and MySQL. Decision factors: ACID compliance, JSON support, team expertise"
```

---

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Memory Hoarding

**Problem**:
```bash
# Storing everything without filtering
buddy-remember "Clicked save button"
buddy-remember "Opened file"
buddy-remember "Took break"
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Store meaningful information only
buddy-remember "Implemented save functionality with optimistic updates for better UX"
```

---

### Anti-Pattern 2: Vague Memories

**Problem**:
```bash
buddy-remember "Fixed bug"
buddy-remember "Updated code"
```

**Solution**:
```bash
buddy-remember "Fixed race condition in user service where concurrent requests created duplicate records. Added database constraint and request deduplication"
```

---

### Anti-Pattern 3: Never Searching

**Problem**:
```bash
# Always creating new, never recalling
buddy-do "implement authentication"
# Reinvents patterns that already exist
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Search first
buddy-remember "authentication patterns"
buddy-remember "existing auth implementation"
# Then build with context
buddy-do "implement authentication following existing patterns"
```

---

### Anti-Pattern 4: Task Overloading

**Problem**:
```bash
buddy-do "implement entire e-commerce platform with cart, checkout, payments, shipping, inventory, admin panel"
```

**Solution**:
```bash
buddy-do "plan e-commerce platform architecture"
# Then break into manageable tasks
buddy-do "implement shopping cart functionality"
buddy-do "implement checkout process"
# etc.
```

---

### Anti-Pattern 5: Context-Free Storage

**Problem**:
```bash
buddy-remember "Using Redis"
buddy-remember "JWT expiry: 24h"
```

**Solution**:
```bash
buddy-remember "Using Redis for session storage because of sub-millisecond latency and built-in expiry"
buddy-remember "JWT expiry set to 24 hours balancing security (limited exposure) and UX (not requiring frequent re-login)"
```

---

## Advanced Techniques

### Templated Memories

**Create reusable templates**:
```bash
# Decision template
buddy-remember "DECISION: [What] because [Why]. Alternatives considered: [Options]. Trade-offs: [Pros/Cons]"

# Bug fix template
buddy-remember "BUG FIX: [Problem] caused by [Root Cause]. Fixed by [Solution]. Prevented by [Tests/Checks]"

# Pattern template
buddy-remember "PATTERN: All [Entity] follow [Pattern] for [Reason]. Example: [Code/Link]"
```

---

### Hierarchical Knowledge

**Build knowledge layers**:
```bash
# Layer 1: High-level architecture
buddy-remember "System architecture: Microservices - API Gateway, Auth Service, User Service, Order Service, Payment Service"

# Layer 2: Service details
buddy-remember "User Service: Node.js + Express, PostgreSQL, REST API, handles user CRUD and profile management"

# Layer 3: Implementation specifics
buddy-remember "User Service authentication: JWT middleware validates tokens, checks permissions, injects user context"
```

---

### Cross-Referencing

**Link related knowledge**:
```bash
buddy-remember "Authentication uses JWT (see: JWT configuration). Tokens stored in Redis (see: Redis setup). Refresh every 24h (see: Token expiry policy)"
```

---

### Version Tracking

**Track changes over time**:
```bash
buddy-remember "API v1: REST endpoints, deprecated 2026-01"
buddy-remember "API v2: GraphQL, launched 2026-01, current standard"
buddy-remember "API migration guide: v1→v2 mapping at /docs/api-migration"
```

---

### Problem-Solution Pairs

**Document troubleshooting**:
```bash
buddy-remember "PROBLEM: High database CPU usage. CAUSE: Missing index on users.email. SOLUTION: Added index, CPU dropped 80%"

buddy-remember "PROBLEM: Intermittent 500 errors. CAUSE: Connection pool exhaustion. SOLUTION: Increased pool size from 10 to 50, added connection monitoring"
```
